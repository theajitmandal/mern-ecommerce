TypeScript Special Types
TypeScript includes several special types that have specific behaviors in the type system.

These types are used in various scenarios to handle cases where the type might not be known in advance or when you need to work with JavaScript primitives in a type-safe way.

Note: These special types are part of TypeScript's type system and help make your code more type-safe and self-documenting.

Type: any
The any type is the most flexible type in TypeScript.

It essentially tells the compiler to skip type checking for a particular variable.

While this can be useful in certain situations, it should be used sparingly as it bypasses TypeScript's type safety features.

When to use any:

When migrating JavaScript code to TypeScript
When working with dynamic content where the type is unknown
When you need to opt out of type checking for a specific case
The example below does not use any and will throw an error:

Example without anyGet your own TypeScript Server
let u = true;
u = "string"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
Math.round(u); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
Setting a variable to the special type any disables type checking:

Example with any
let v: any = true;
v = "string"; // no error as it can be "any" type
Math.round(v); // no error as it can be "any" type
any can be a useful way to get past errors since it disables type checking, but TypeScript will not be able to provide type safety, and tools which rely on type data, such as auto completion, will not work.

Remember, it should be avoided at "any" cost...

Type: unknown
The unknown type is a type-safe counterpart of any.

It's the type-safe way to say "this could be anything, so you must perform some type of checking before you use it".

Key differences between unknown and any:

unknown must be type-checked before use
You can't access properties on an unknown type without type assertion
You can't call or construct values of type unknown
TypeScript will prevent unknown types from being used without proper type checking, as shown in the example below:

Example
let w: unknown = 1;
w = "string"; // no error
w = {
  runANonExistentMethod: () => {
    console.log("I think therefore I am");
  }
} as { runANonExistentMethod: () => void}
// How can we avoid the error for the code commented out below when we don't know the type?
// w.runANonExistentMethod(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
if(typeof w === 'object' && w !== null) {
  (w as { runANonExistentMethod: Function }).runANonExistentMethod();
}
// Although we have to cast multiple times we can do a check in the if to secure our type and have a safer casting
When to use unknown:

When working with data from external sources (APIs, user input, etc.)
When you want to ensure type safety while still allowing flexibility
When migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript in a type-safe way
Type narrowing with unknown:

You can narrow down the type of an unknown value using type guards:

function processValue(value: unknown) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    // value is now treated as string
    console.log(value.toUpperCase());
  } else if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    // value is now treated as any[]
    console.log(value.length);
  }
}
Type: never
The never type represents the type of values that never occur.

It's used to indicate that something never happens or should never happen.

Common use cases for never:

Functions that never return (always throw an error or enter an infinite loop)
Type guards that never pass type checking
Exhaustiveness checking in discriminated unions
Examples of never in action:
1. Function that never returns
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
2. Exhaustiveness checking with discriminated unions
type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case 'circle':
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case 'square':
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    default:
      // TypeScript knows this should never happen
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
      return _exhaustiveCheck;
  }
}
3. Basic never type (throws error when assigned)
let x: never = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'never'.
When to use never:

For functions that will never return a value
In type guards that should never match
For exhaustive type checking in switch statements
In generic types to indicate certain cases are impossible
Type: undefined & null
In TypeScript, both undefined and null have their own types, just like string or number.

By default, these types can be assigned to any other type, but this can be changed with TypeScript's strict null checks.

Key points about undefined and null:

undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value
null is an explicit assignment that represents no value or no object
In TypeScript, both have their own types: undefined and null respectively
With strictNullChecks enabled, you must explicitly handle these types
Basic Usage
let y: undefined = undefined;
let z: null = null;
Optional Parameters and Properties
// Optional parameter (implicitly `string | undefined`)
function greet(name?: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name || 'stranger'}`;
}

// Optional property in an interface
interface User {
  name: string;
  age?: number; // Same as `number | undefined`
}
Nullish Coalescing and Optional Chaining
// Nullish coalescing (??) - only uses default if value is null or undefined
const value = input ?? 'default';

// Optional chaining (?.) - safely access nested properties
const street = user?.address?.street;
Important: These types are most useful when strictNullChecks is enabled in your tsconfig.json file.

This ensures that null and undefined are only assignable to themselves and any.

To enable strict null checks, add this to your tsconfig.json:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
